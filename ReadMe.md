# General Assembly Homework 3 - Trulia BnB

  

Homework assignment #3 for General Assembly's Front End Web Development Boot Camp. The assignment was to 
-   Combine CSS Grid with Flexbox.
-   Deeply nest HTML elements.
-   Use classes with your CSS.
-   Style a full website from start to finish.
-   **Bonus**: Plan cross-device compatibility.

You’ll be rebuilding part of a real website: trulia.com.

We’ll still give you content and colors and fonts like the last assignment, but this is much more difficult. You’ll need to consider how to create this layout before diving in.

-   Figure out the right semantic structure for the document. This is hard for a complex, real-world site! We’ve helped you out a bit — check out the end of the starter code.
-   Think how you could use grid and flexbox together, and experiment.
